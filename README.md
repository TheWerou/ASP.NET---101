# About
This is my mini ASP.NET series. The goal is to provide readers with enough knowledge to start developing with ASP.NET. I plan to cover topics including Setup, REST APIs, SignalR, and Entity Framework with LINQ.
# Setup
In this article, I will explain how to set up a new ASP.NET project and what configurations are necessary. This project will also serve as a go-to template for creating ASP.NET applications and for teaching ASP.NET to others.
# REST
The purpose of this article is to provide you with practical, hands-on knowledge for building a REST API.
We will walk through the essential components required for creating API endpoints, covering both data input and data output techniques.
# EF + LINQ
Work in progress
# SignalR
