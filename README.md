# About
This is my mini ASP.NET series. The goal is to provide readers with enough knowledge to start developing with ASP.NET. I plan to cover topics including Setup, REST APIs, SignalR, and Entity Framework with LINQ.
# Setup
In this article, I will explain how to set up a new ASP.NET project and what configurations are necessary. This project will also serve as a go-to template for creating ASP.NET applications and for teaching ASP.NET to others.
# REST

# EF + LINQ
